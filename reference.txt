module 2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	lesson 3.1
		create several js files to ease coding
		combine all together in a single JS by bundling, using bundlers or package libraries
		to get to use other packages in our code we need to install npm package manager
			download and install latest from nodejs.org
			in vscode terminal type npm -v to check npm version
			in vscode terminal type npm -ini -y to initialise npm
				this will create a package.json file in the project dir tree
		vite is a frontend tooling package, it has a plug n play bundler.
		the most commom use of vite is to run npm create vite@latest
		as the install is half way trough the project run npm i vite --save-dev
			the package.json file received a dependency
				there are two types of dependencies:
					dependencies-included in the bundle as the app depends on it
					development dependencies-not included in the bundle. just used to develop		
			a new folder node_modules is created
				do not change the folder, althoug it can be deleted and recreated by run npm i
		update the script to "dev": "vite"
		npm run dev starts the local server to test the app

	lesson 3.3
		dynamically typed programming is when the type of a variable is determined at 
		runtime rather than at compile time
		statically typed programming is when the type of a variable is enforced.
		javascript does not allow for that so we need to use typescript
		use typescript
			install typescript
				in the terminal stop vite
				run npm i typescript --save-dev
			change .js file extension to .ts
			update in html file
		javascript needs to be configured before using it but vite does that in the background
		browsers don't understand typescript so it needs to be compiled vite does that in background
		changing the file extension will highlight errors that need to be fixed
